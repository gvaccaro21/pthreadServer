This repo is going to be used for our CE Concentration thread Project. For those of you that are new to Git here are some general tips and commands to do before making any changes to the repositories.

Rules:
Before editing any files/ adding any files ALWAYS pull the repositories. You do this by putting the following command into the git folder:

i) "git pull origin master" 

	The steps once you created and/or added a new file to the repository are as follows:

i) “git add -A” 

	This is going to add and update any changes.

ii) “git commit -m “commit message” 

	As annoying as this step may be, the git will not allow you to commit without writing the message and it keeps everyone updated on any changes you made to the 	file.

iii) “git push origin master”

 	This command is going to push all of the changes to the repository.

That is pretty much all the basics of git. Don’t forget to ALWAYS pull before start doing ANYTHING in the repository and make sure to talk to anyone on the team to ensure that you are not working on the same files otherwise there will be problems. 

If there are any issues just contact me (Giuseppe Vaccaro) or Joe Gibbs immediately!!!
